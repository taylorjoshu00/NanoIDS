## Step 4: App Layer Protocol configuration
##

# Configure the app-layer parsers.
#
# The error-policy setting applies to all app-layer parsers. Values can be
# "drop-flow", "pass-flow", "bypass", "drop-packet", "pass-packet", "reject" or
# "ignore" (the default).
#
# The protocol's section details each protocol.
#
# The option "enabled" takes 3 values - "yes", "no", "detection-only".
# "yes" enables both detection and the parser, "no" disables both, and
# "detection-only" enables protocol detection only (parser disabled).

      #            TLS parsing and inspection. Offload flow bypass to kernel
      #            or hardware if possible.
      # - full:    keep tracking and inspection as normal. Unmodified content
      #            keyword signatures are inspected as well.
